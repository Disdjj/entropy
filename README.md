> Parano√Ød about having secrets leaked in your huge codebase? Entropy is here to help you find them!

# Entropy

Entropy is a CLI tool that will **scan your codebase for high entropy lines**, which are often secrets.

## Installation

If you have Go installed

```bash
go install github.com/EwenQuim/entropy@latest
entropy
```

or in one line

```bash
go run github.com/EwenQuim/entropy@latest
```

### With brew

WIP

## Usage

I don't want to maintain a documentation here, so just run

```bash
entropy -h
```

as it will always be up to date.
